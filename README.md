# simple Note Taking app
This repo started as A SnapKitStudy repo but became a simple project about a note taking app that contains two separate database:
* Local with realm
* Remote with Firebase Database

The firebase database is available to "everyone" with the same build of the app, everyone can edit and upload it.

### Technologies used
* RXSwift & RXCocoa to make the code more reactive and to simplify creation of certain UI elements like buttons and TableViews
* VIP as the architecture of the code, probably has some spots where is not being correclty applied, feel free to point them in the issues tab
* CocoaPods as Dependency manager
* SnapKit to make constraints more readables.

### TODO
- [x] nothing at the moment, feel free to suggest!
